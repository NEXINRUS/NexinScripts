It has come to my attention that my script has been stolen and reuploaded—most likely by a bot—without my permission. In response, I’ve implemented protective measures. I won’t be sharing the details publicly for obvious reasons, but steps have been taken.

You can find the stolen version here:

This is also a warning to fellow script creators, do not leave your source code exposed. They will take it and claim it as their own.
