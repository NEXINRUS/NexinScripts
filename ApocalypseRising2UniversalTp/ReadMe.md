# 👤 UniversalTP | Apocalypse Rising 2

## 📘 Introduction  
Hello. Welcome to the **UniversalTP GitHub page**. This is the **only** official page for this script, so any others are likely **scams** or **malicious copies**.

## ⚙️ Features  
What the script does:  
- 🧟‍♂️ Teleports dead corpses to you so you can loot the corpses  
- 🚗 Teleports cars to you

---

## 🔌 Compatibility  
These scripts work well with **UniversalTP**:

- ✅ [**Den.net**](https://github.com/dengertheguy/den.net) – An **ESP script** for Apocalypse Rising 2  
- ✅ [**Infinite Yield**](https://infyiff.github.io/Download.html) – ESP and chams support  
  ⚠️ *Note:* Infinite Yield may break in large games. If it does, simply rejoin and run it again.

---

## ⚠️ Important  
When using the **car teleporting** feature, be careful not to enter the vehicle too quickly.  
Doing so may result in being kicked with a message like:

> **"Cream of Mushroom"** 🍄

Don’t worry — this **doesn’t mean you’re hacking**. It just means the teleport triggered a part of the game’s anticheat system.

📘 Guides on how to use the features are provided below.
