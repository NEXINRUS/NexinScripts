## 🔌 Compatibility  
### This tells you what works with this script

Really any script works with **UniversalTP**, but here are some I recommend:

- ✅ [**Den.net**](https://github.com/dengertheguy/den.net) – An ESP script for *Apocalypse Rising 2*  
- ✅ [**Infinite Yield**](https://infyiff.github.io/Download.html) – ESP and chams support  
  ⚠️ *Note:* Infinite Yield may break in large games. If it does, just rejoin and run it again.

---

## ⚠️ Important  
When using the **car teleporting** feature, be careful not to enter the vehicle too quickly.  
Doing so may result in being kicked with a message like:

> **"Cream of Mushroom"**

Don’t worry — this **doesn’t mean the game has detected you cheating**, it just means it triggered a part of the game’s anticheat system.
