# 👤UniversalTP👤 | Apocalypse Rising 2

## 📘 Introduction  
Hello. Welcome to the **UniversalTP GitHub page**. This is the **only** GitHub page for this script, so any others are likely **scams** or **malicious**. 

## ⚙️ Features  
What the script does:  
- 🧟‍♂️ Teleports dead corpses to you so you can loot the corpses.  
- 🚗 Teleports cars to you.

# Compatibility
This shows what scripts are best to use with **UniversalTP**. 
Really any script works with it but I recommend [Den.net](https://github.com/dengertheguy/den.net). It is a esp script for Apocalypse Rising 2.
[Infinite Yield's](https://infyiff.github.io/Download.html) esp and chams work as well. But sometimes infinite yield breaks when in big games. If it does,  rejoin and run [Infinite Yield](https://infyiff.github.io/Download.html) again.

# ⚠️ Important
When using the **car teleporting** feature, be careful not to enter the vehicle too quickly.  
Doing so may result in being kicked with a message like **"Cream of Mushroom."**   
Don't worry — this **doesn't mean you're hacking**, it just triggers a part of the game's anticheat system.

📘 Guides on how to use the features are provided below.
