UPDATES / FIXES 

--== Whitelist Service Fixed == --

The issue stemmed from the GitHub-hosted whitelist file not updating or loading quickly enough, which caused some user IDs to fail during validation. 
This has now been resolved, and the whitelisting process should work reliably. All we did was hard code the id's to the script for faster validation.

--== Removed Key System ==--

Removed the key system because nobody likes them. And because this is a passion project rather than one driven by commerce (money making).

--== Added Ticket System ==--

Added a ticket system so members can get verified/whitelisted to use the script.
